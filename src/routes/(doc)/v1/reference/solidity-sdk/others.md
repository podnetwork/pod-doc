## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing receipt verification with the pod Solidity SDK, follow these best practices:

1. Always verify the attestation first to ensure the receipt has sufficient validator signatures
2. Then verify specific logs or fields as needed for your application
3. Use proper error handling for verification failures
4. Only process the receipt data after all verifications pass

## Security Considerations

When implementing receipt verification with the Solidity SDK, developers should adhere to these security practices:

- Always validate both attestations and proofs before accepting a receipt as valid
- Ensure the committee data matches the current validator set
- Validate that quorum requirements meet network specifications
- Use correct generalized indices when verifying specific fields
- Implement proper error handling for all verification failure cases
- Maintain secure access controls for any contracts implementing verification
- Never skip verification steps, even for trusted sources
- Consider gas costs when implementing verification in production contracts
